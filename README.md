# Super Awesome Space Shooter 🚀🌌👾

## 🤨 What is this?

This is a space exploration game with bullet hell gameplay and a polar mechanic inspired by games like _Outland_ and _Ikaruga_. Players will explore and navigate dangerous zones in space and fight off fearsome enemies and bosses.

## 🤔 Why?

This is a game I've wanted to make for a long time...since college actually. Also, I'm hoping the gameplay will help with designing the space combat system of _Voidcallers_.

## 🕹 Game Design Document

The GDD will be added to the Wiki of this project. I'll update this with a link.

## 👩‍💻 Contributing

Pull an issue off of the board in the **To do** column and get coding! I'll eventually post more guidelines in a specific file later.
